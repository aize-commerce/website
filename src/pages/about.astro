				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					I'm Berkan Düzgün, a systems architect focused on software platforms where
					technical decisions have direct business consequences.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've spent over a decade inside e-commerce and enterprise systems — primarily
					Adobe Commerce (Magento), but also Salesforce, Intershop, and custom-built
					platforms. My work has ranged from hands-on engineering to technical leadership,
					across agencies, in-house teams, and global marketplaces such as Toptal and Arc.
				</p>
				<p>
					For several years, I was an official Adobe instructor for Magento 2 development,
					training engineers internationally. I've led teams, defined architectural direction,
					and taken responsibility for decisions that either compound into long-term stability
					or quietly turn into technical debt.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've worked on platforms such as Body&Fit, Riviera Maison, Plutosport, FLO, and
					Penti — environments where downtime, performance issues, or architectural missteps
					translate directly into lost revenue and operational friction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over time, a pattern became hard to ignore: most of the expensive problems I was
					brought in to fix were preventable. They originated upstream — in platform choices,
					system boundaries, integration strategies, and early architectural assumptions that
					no longer held under real load.
				</p>
				<p class="focus">That's where I focus now.</p>
				<p>
					I work upstream of implementation, helping teams reason through architectural
					trade-offs before they become costly to reverse. This includes system evaluations,
					platform selection, boundary definition, and decision support around complex
					integrations and long-term sustainability.
				</p>
				<p>
					I run Aize, a small practice focused on technical advisory and architecture work.
					Based in Europe, I work with teams where the software decisions genuinely matter.
