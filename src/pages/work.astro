				<h1>Work</h1>
				<p>
					I work with teams on high-impact technical decisions — the points where
					architecture, platforms, and system design shape what becomes possible later.
				</p>
				<p>
					My involvement is focused on clarity and direction rather than volume of delivery.
					Engagements are typically scoped around specific phases where decisions are
					expensive to reverse.
				</p>

				<h2>Architectural Reviews & System Audits</h2>
				<p>I review existing systems to surface structural risks and decision bottlenecks.</p>
				<p>This includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>system boundaries and coupling</li>
					<li>integration patterns and constraints</li>
					<li>scalability and maintainability risks</li>
					<li>assumptions baked into the architecture that no longer hold</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The outcome is a clear picture of trade-offs and options — designed to
					support your decision, not prescribe mine.
				</p>

				<h2>Platform & Technology Decisions</h2>
				<p>Platform choices create long-term leverage — and long-term cost.</p>
				<p>
					I support teams evaluating or re-evaluating platforms such as Adobe Commerce,
					Shopify, Salesforce, and custom systems, with attention to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>whether it actually fits how the business operates</li>
					<li>extensibility and integration constraints</li>
					<li>long-term ownership cost and complexity</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The goal is to reduce uncertainty before commitment.</p>

				<h2>System Boundaries & Integration Design</h2>
				<p>As systems grow, integration becomes the primary source of complexity.</p>
				<p>I help teams reason about:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>system ownership and boundaries</li>
					<li>responsibility and data flow</li>
					<li>where to decouple and where coordination is necessary</li>
					<li>how architectural decisions age over time</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					This work often happens ahead of large initiatives, migrations, or multi-team efforts.
				</p>

				<h2>Advisory Engagements</h2>
				<p>
					Some teams need a one-time review. Others want ongoing access to someone
					who can pressure-test decisions, join planning conversations, or provide
					guidance during transitions.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've done both. The format depends on what you're navigating — the goal
					is the same: keep the architecture coherent as the system and organization evolve.
				</p>

				<h2>Engagements</h2>
				<p>
					Work usually begins with a conversation to understand context, constraints,
					and decision points.
				</p>
				<p>From there, engagements are typically structured as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a focused review or audit</li>
					<li>a time-bound advisory phase</li>
					<li>or an ongoing advisory relationship</li>
				</ul>
